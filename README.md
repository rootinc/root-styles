# Root Styles
This is our sass library for the base Root Inc styles. Currently it includes color and typography.

> **Note:** By default the fonts are being pulled from S3 and Google Fonts. If our app needs everything in a local package, we'll have to copy the fonts to our local machine and edit how the fonts are requested.

## Installation
To use this for a project, we install it as an NPM package.

```sh
npm i git+https://github.com/rootinc/root-styles.git --save
```
